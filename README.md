I.Introduction
--------------

#Fiskenatet is auction site specialised in fish and seafood auctions, the target groups are retail, restaurants, hotels and occasionally private people.
The main idea with the site is to save the buyers time and effort. As a buyer its not requiered to attend the auction since you 
can monitor everything on your computer and that will save the buyer valuable time. #Fiskenätet also supplies with storage for up to 24 hours after the purchase so the fish stays fresh until pickup/delivery.
The auction winner can choose to pickup the winning auction or to get it delivered.
